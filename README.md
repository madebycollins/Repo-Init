# Repo-Init
A simple bash script to initialise a repository so you can get right to work :)

# About
I work on personal and work projects using git. And it's annoying to have to set up the folder to use seperate git names, and emails each time. This script will create the folder and repo for you automatically :)

## How to use
- Clone or download the repo
- Place the **init_repo.sh** inside the root of your work folder
- Replace the example@example.com email & name with your work email and name
- Run the file each time you begin working on a new work or personal project to have the directory & repo initialised for you
